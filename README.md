# Real-world-evaluation-of-acoustic-side-channel-attacks-on-keyboards
This project addresses the rising threat of side-channel attacks by developing an advanced acoustic keystroke detection model using deep learning techniques. The primary objectives include analysing keyboard acoustic data, implementing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for detection, and evaluating its real-world effectiveness. Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for feature extraction, the model was trained and tested on a total dataset of 2877 samples, achieving an average training accuracy of 94.11% and a testing accuracy of 92.84%. Real-world evaluation highlighted the modelâ€™s capacity to generalise well but also underscored challenges in noise sensitivity and class imbalance. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning for acoustic keystroke detection, contributing significantly to cybersecurity measures against side-channel attacks.
