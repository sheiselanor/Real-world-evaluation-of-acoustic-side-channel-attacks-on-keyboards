# Real-world-evaluation-of-acoustic-side-channel-attacks-on-keyboards
This project addresses the rising threat of side-channel attacks by developing an advanced acoustic keystroke detection model using deep learning techniques. The primary objectives include analysing keyboard acoustic data, implementing  a LSTM network for detection, and evaluating its real-world effectiveness.
